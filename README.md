ofxSMTP
=======

An SMTP Client (including SSL/TLS for Gmail, etc).

Note: When using this with Gmail, you may find it useful to create an [app-specific password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en).  You may also need to enable "[Less secure apps](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en)", but try it without doing that first.


NOTE:  This is compatible with openFrameworks 0.9.0 or greater.  Past versions of openFrameworks shoudl use previous releases.

For now, also requires ofxSSLManager (https://github.com/bakercp/ofxSSLManager).
